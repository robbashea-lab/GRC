# Northstar GRC — Product Requirements

## Original problem
Multi-tenant B2B GRC platform (Linear/Notion-inspired). Roles: Super Admin, Platform Admin, Client Contributor, Client Read-Only. Tenant isolation, audit log, @mention comments, evidence uploads, reusable Review workflow, connected Findings/Tasks/Risks, Policies with 2-step approval + history, Vendors, Assets, Exceptions register, Baseline wizard, overdue email reminders, notifications inbox, CSV/PDF exports, calendar with drag-to-reschedule, bulk actions incl. change due date, self-service password reset with full session invalidation.

## Architecture
- Backend FastAPI + MongoDB (motor). server.py mounts api + entity_router at end.
- Auth: JWT bearer (`iat` claim + `password_changed_at` gate) + Emergent Google OAuth (db.sessions rows) + self-serve password reset (2h TTL, single-use, sha256-hashed).
- Frontend React 19 + react-router 7 + shadcn/ui + sonner + lucide-react.
- Cron: `.emergent/crons.yml` daily 13:00 UTC overdue-reminders.
- Emails via Emergent Resend; PDFs via reportlab.

## Implemented (Feb 2026)
### v1
- Multi-tenant auth, roles, tenant scoping, client org selector
- CRUD for Reviews / Findings / Risks / Policies / Vendors / Assets / Tasks
- Evidence uploads, comments, audit log, command-center dashboard

### v2
- Baseline Assessment wizard, quick actions (Review→Finding, Finding→Task)
- Related-items tab, Exceptions Register, Overdue Reminders + cron

### v3
- Notifications inbox (@mentions + auto-assignment), Policy approvals with history
- CSV exports per record kind, Evidence tab inside every drawer

### v4
- Bulk actions (close / set-status / set-owner / delete) with RBAC + tenant scoping
- Calendar month grid, Board Report PDF

### v5
- Password Reset (forgot + reset endpoints, /forgot-password + /reset-password pages)
- Bulk Set Due Date action + date-picker popover
- Drag-To-Reschedule on Calendar (preserves original time-of-day)

### v6
- **Session Invalidation on password reset** — JWTs now carry `iat`; `password_changed_at` on user rejects any JWT issued before the reset; all rows in `db.sessions` for the user are deleted on reset (Emergent Google OAuth cookies); reset response returns `sessions_revoked`

## P1 backlog
- Vendor Portal (guest link for due-diligence questionnaires)
- Bulk Assign Reviewer (people picker for reviewer_id)
- Notifications filters (unread-only / mentions / tenant)
- Brute-force lockout on /auth/login
- Extract server.py into modules
